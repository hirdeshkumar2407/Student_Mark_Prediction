## AI LAB Project 
This project was assigned to us by course instructor Ma'am Noor Saqib as our AI LAB project. In this project, we had to different machine learning models ,like Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Tree Regression, and Random Forest Tree Classifier, to find the influence of various factors in student's performance.

## Dataset 
We used this dataset 

[Student Grade Prediction Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/dipam7/student-grade-prediction) by Dipam Vasani and [UCI Machine Learning Repository] (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

## Result


| Model        | Accuracy         
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Linear Regression| 84.0% | 
| Lasso Regression | 85.2% |    
| Ridge Regression | 82.4% |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 70.0% |
| Random Forest Regression | 87.0% |
| Random Forest Classifier | 86.0% |
