## AI LAB Project 
This project was assigned to us by course instructor Ma'am Noor Saqib as our AI LAB project.In this project, we had to find the influence of various factors on student performance. We used Python various libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Numpy. We test different machine learning models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Tree Regression, and Random Forest Tree Classifier.

## Dataset 
We used this dataset 

[Student Grade Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dipam7/student-grade-prediction) by Dipam Vasani and [UCI Machine Learning Repository\(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance)

## Result


| Model        | Accuracy         
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Linear Regression| 84.0% | 
| Lasso Regression | 85.2% |    
| Ridge Regression | 82.4% |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 70.0% |
| Random Forest Regression | 87.0% |
| Random Forest Classifier | 86.0% |
